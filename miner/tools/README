Tools used in text mining
	histogram.py is used to look at a text and generate a word count
	and percentage use table.  It ignores http and sentence punctuation,
 	all words are lowecased.  Finally, histogram ignores the words in
	the stopwords.txt file.

	One use that was interesting was to generate a stream of all the
	words in the files analyzed and then focus on the words that are
	interesting for knowledge mining.  From this list you can then
	look at the data and create a table of false and true counts, to
	prove your guess that a given word is a true positive.

	stopwords.txt is a list of words to be ignored from reporting using
	histogram.py  The stopwords were derived from this web site:
